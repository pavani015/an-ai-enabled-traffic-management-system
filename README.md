   This project is titled “Improvised  Traffic Light Control System  using Deep Learning” Bikes are an extremely mainstream method of transportation in India. However, there is a high risk involved due to a lack of protection. To decrease the involved risk, it is highly desirable for motorcycle riders to use helmets. That’s why the government has made it a punishable offense to ride a bike without a helmet. The drawback of the current method where human intervention is required can be solved by our proposed method. Nowadays everyone is moving towards automation and many countries have implemented automatic traffic surveillance systems. Here we are developing a system in which we are using a more efficient way which helps us in getting better results.
